Hi there! I couldn't help but notice that you've made the mistake of placing
ye olde Englishe word 'thy' before a word beginning with a vowel (A E I O U, 
and including H) - hence it should rather be 'thine'. 

In your case, you have written '*thy {0}*' when it should be '*thine {0}*'.
You can see that the word '*{0}*' begins with the vowel '*{1}*', and 
so, follows the aforementioned rule. 

Hopefully that was helpful for you! Interested in learning more? Why not check

on thy/thine? Go (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English#Pronouns)[here]! (Middle english made the distinction between
singular and plural 'you' - whereas today we use only the one form. Also
that th sound is actually a single letter - it's called the (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28letter%29)[thorn]. It's still
in use in Icelandic - which is a language that has in fact many old features
still retained.)
