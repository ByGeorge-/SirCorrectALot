Tackle misuse of "thee" or rather lack of. For example "bless thy" when it should be bless thee. A naive way to implement this would be to see if verb comes before, but of course you could get "none above thee" which is perfectly valid but has no verb. a better way would be to check for an object. thee is a pronoun, thy is a demonstrative so it is.
