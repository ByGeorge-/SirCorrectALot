"Quoted Text"

Hi there! I couldn't help but notice that you've made the mistake of placing
ye olde Englishe word 'thy' before a word beginning with a vowel (A E I O U, 
and including H) - hence it should rather be 'thine'. 

In your case, you have written '<i>thy userword</i>' when it should be '<i>thine userword</i>'.
You can see that the word '<i>userword</i>' begins with the vowel '<i>uservowel</i>', and 
so, follows the aforementioned rule.

singular and plural 'you' - whereas today we use only the one form. Also
that th sound is actually a single letter - it's called the (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28letter%29)[thorn]. It's still
in use in Icelandic - which is a language that has in fact many old features
still retained.)
