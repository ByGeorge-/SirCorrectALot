SirCorrectALot
===============

SirCorrectALot is the name of a bot that scours forums and websites such
as [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) for comments that misuse English - 
specifically 'thy' before a vowel (which should be 'thine'). 

Ideally, it will leave a comment as a reply to the offending comment, with a 
quote of the offending text before going into more detail. 

The comment will include a correction of the offending word using the
user's actual word and also provide an explaination:

"When 'thy' is followed by a word that begins with a vowel, it becomes 'thine'.
So basically, the correct way to say it should be thine + userword"

Basic regular expressions should be used to account for all the different forms
such as thy Thy THY etc. 

More details to follow.
